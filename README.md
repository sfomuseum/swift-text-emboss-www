# swift-text-emboss-www

A simple HTTP server wrapping the `sfomuseum/swift-text-emboss` package.

## Important

This package has only minimal error reporting and validation. It has no authentication or authorization hooks.

## Example

Building the server.

```
$> swift build
Building for debugging...
[1/1] Compiling plugin GenerateManual
Build complete! (0.11s)
```

Server start-up options.

```
$> ./.build/debug/text-emboss-server -h
USAGE: text-emboss-server [--port <port>] [--max_size <max_size>]

OPTIONS:
  --port <port>           The port number to start the server on. (default: 8080)
  --max_size <max_size>   The maximum allowed size in bytes for uploads. (default: 10000000)
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

Running the server.

```
$> ./.build/debug/text-emboss-server
2023-08-31T11:36:32-0700 info org.sfomuseum.text-emboss-server : [text_emboss_server] Server has started on port 8080 and is listening for requests.
```

And then (given [this image](https://collection.sfomuseum.org/objects/1779445165/)):

```
$> curl -F image=@1779445839_SfgRA4d51gAzgbClRnghkRVINAw2rOjF_b.jpg http://localhost:8080/
THE SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORTS COMMISSION PRESENTS
TOYS THAT TRAVEL
DECEMBER 14 -
- FEBRUARY 28, 1982
FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE OAKLAND MUSEUM AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS
SAN FRANCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT â€¢ NORTH TERMINAL STIR
```

### JSON

The return provenance and creation time for the text extracted from an image use the `/json` endpoint which will return a JSON-encoded dictionary containing that information.

```
$> curl -s -F image=@fixtures/sfomuseum-pin-2019.081.021.jpg http://localhost:8080/json | jq
{
  "created": 1701894618,
  "text": "SANDY HERRMANN",
  "source": "com.apple.visionkit.VNImageRequestHandler#Version 14.1.2 (Build 23B92)"
}
```

Note: The `source` key is an arbitrary string used to identify the processes, or models, from which image text was derived. As of this writing this string has no standard formatting or requirements. If and when those conventions are established this package will be updated to use them.
